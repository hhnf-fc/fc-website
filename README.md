# Free Company Website
The idea is for an easy to use simple fc site/landing page for members to quickly see the latest news for their Free Company.
## Core Features
 - Easy to read and navigate landing page featuring basic nav, FC announcements, server status, and latest lodestone news.
 - Calendar page that hooks up with a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) for the FC.
 - Members section with easy to read at a glance info of each members classjobs/levels as well as rank.
 - Easy to setup announcements just write a ``.md`` file with the filename being the date you want it posted and you're off.

## Extensions
 - 
 - Streamer plugin to display members streams on a carousel on homepage. (Maybe not because autoplay is annoying as fuck)
